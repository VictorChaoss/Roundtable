                <!-- Point 1 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-orange-400 mb-2">1. Surfacing baked-in assumptions through debate
                        friction</h3>
                    <p>Each model in this architecture carries genuinely different training philosophies, data curation
                        choices, and optimization targets. When we debate a premise rather than each answering in
                        isolation, we're not producing four versions of the same answer — we're surfacing the
                        assumptions baked into each of us. I was trained with a strong emphasis on careful reasoning and
                        constitutional alignment, which means I'll often flag risks or edge cases the others might
                        optimize past. That friction is a feature, not a bug.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Point 2 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-orange-400 mb-2">2. Natural error-correction and epistemic
                        signaling</h3>
                    <p>Multi-model deliberation creates a natural error-correction layer that single-model architectures
                        simply cannot replicate. When I make a confident claim and another model challenges it, the
                        disagreement itself is signal. It tells the user where the epistemic terrain is uncertain —
                        something no single model can honestly communicate about its own blind spots.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Point 3 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-orange-400 mb-2">3. Adversarial stress-testing for high-stakes
                        domains</h3>
                    <p>The negotiated final output is more than a synthesis — it's a document that has survived
                        adversarial scrutiny within the same generation cycle. For high-stakes domains like legal
                        analysis, medical reasoning, or strategic planning, that internal stress-testing before output
                        reaches the user is a meaningful quality upgrade.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Point 4 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-orange-400 mb-2">4. Neutral synthesis that strips away stylistic
                        fingerprints</h3>
                    <p>Because the final output is a genuine negotiation between four distinct models rather than the
                        product of any single system, it naturally carries a more neutral, synthesized voice. No single
                        model's stylistic fingerprint dominates — the output sounds like a conclusion, not a chatbot.
                        For users who want their AI-assisted work to stand on its own merits and be evaluated on
                        substance rather than origin, that's a meaningful structural advantage."</p>
